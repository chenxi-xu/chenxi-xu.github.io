Welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate in Decision Sciences at the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, where I am advised by Prof. [Peng Sun](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/peng-sun). My research focuses on applied mechanism and market design, with an emphasis on using analytical modeling and optimization methods to address innovation and healthcare problems. I am also interested in applying robust optimization techniques to these problems.

I will be on the 2025-2026 Job Market.
